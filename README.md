# Meal You 

## Your personal recipes book and meal planner.

This is a simple website to create, store, and plan your favourites meals for a day you choose to eat them. :pizza:

## :grey_exclamation: Technologies that should be used :

:bangbang: 
During writing this project i learned a lot.
Yet i know the framework such as **tailwind.css** or **Sass** should be used for css along with **BEM** structure.

## In the Future!

Meal You is **my first beginner project** so the gate is open for further improvement... someday :sweat_smile:

:white_check_mark: Notifications,
:white_check_mark: Users lobby with chat window,
:white_check_mark: calories, micro and makro counters,
:white_check_mark: functional shopping list, easier to edit.

and hopefully more!
